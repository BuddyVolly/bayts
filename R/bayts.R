#' @title Bayesian approach to combine multiple time series for near real-time forest change detection
#' 
#' @description (i) Creates "bayts" time series data frame from multiple input time series and calculates time series of normalised conditional non-forest probabilities (PNF). 
#' (ii) Iterative Bayesian updating of the conditional probability of change (PChange) based on PNF and detection of change
#' @details Short method description: First, the conditional probability for non-forest (PNF) is estimated for each individual time series observation, using the corresponding sensor specific probability density functions (pdfs) for forest (F) and non-forest (NF).
#' In case of multiple observation at the same date, PNF is interatively updated using Bayesian probability updating (\code{\link{calcPosterior}}). 
#' Observations at time t (current observation) are flagged to be potentially changed in the case that the conditional NF probability (PNF) is larger than 0.5. 
#' For a flagged observation, the conditional probability of change (PChange) is computed by iterative Bayesian updating (\code{\link{calcPosterior}}), using the previous observation (t âˆ’ 1), 
#' the current observation (t), as well as i upcoming observations (t + i) to confirm or reject a change event at t. A change is confirmed in case PChange exceeds a given threshold "chi".
#' A detailed description is provided in  \href{http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/7/5/4973}{Reiche et al. 2015} (Chapter 2.1.2 and 2.1.3).


#' @param tsL list of object(s) of class \code{\link{ts}}.
#' @param pdfL list of "pdf" object(s) describing F and NF distributions (see \code{\link{calcPNF}}). 
#' "pdf" object: pdf[1] = pdf type F, pdf[2] = pdf type NF, pdf[3] and pdf[4] = pdf parameter describing F, pdf[5] and pdf[6] = pdf parameter describing NF. pdf types supported: Gaussian or Weibull.
#' @param bwf block weighting function to truncate the NF probability; Default=c(0.1,0.9); (c(0,1) = no truncation) 
#' @param chi Threshold of Pchange at which the change is confirmed; Default=0.5
#' @param PNFmin threshold of pNF above which the first observation is flagged; Default=0.5
#' @param start Start date of monitoring period. Default=NULL (start of input time series).
#' @param end End date of monitoring period. Default=NULL (end of input time series)
