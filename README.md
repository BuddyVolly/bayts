Package for a propabalistic approach to combine multiple univariate time series (e.g. optical and SAR) for deforestation detection (Reiche et al., 2015, 2017). 

## Probablistic approach for combining time series and near real-time deforstation detection
The basic approach has been published in Reiche et al., 2015 and was refined in Reiche et al. (under review). In Reiche et al., 2017, the probabalistic approach was used to combine univariate Landsat NDVI, Sentinel-1 VV and ALSO-PALSAR HV time series for detecting deforestation in near real-time over a tropical dry forest site in Santa Cruz, Bolivia 

A detailed description of theapproach is provided in [Reiche et al. 2015,17]. A brief description
